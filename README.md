## Overview

Working with MongoDB was an interesting experience since I am now really familiar with SQL. Learning about NOSQL databases and documents I initially thought that it would be disorganized and hard to navigate. Coming from SQL I am finally comfortable thinking in rows and setting up table columns to organize all our data. Working on this project allowed me to work with multiple collections in the same NOSQL database, a feature that in hindsight, would be vital to be a competitor to SQL databases. Working through the project made me appreciate how easy it was to set up posts, deletes, and updates however working with all the new features within MongooseJS turned out to be a really overwhelming experience. I'm sure I have only scrated the surface of the language but it was a great learning experience.


## Challenges

Due to the schedule we had to work on, these technologies were thrown at us over the course of a single week. 
Trying to understand and read the documentation was the most challenging part 
however this was a great project that allowed me to research the problems I was encountering and strengthened my ability to understand and process documentation, which as always been a weak point for me as a visual learner.


## Conclusion
Overall a great project and I thoroughly enjoyed completeing it as I think NOSQL databases are an important concept to understand and utilize. Although this project took me longer than most other projects, I think it attests to the amount of knowledge I gained from completeing it.
