## Overview
 
straight forward project
we were given a good draft of what we needed to code
completing the tasks really showed the areas where I am uncomfortable with mongo, mongoose, and express



## Challenges

Due to the schedule we had to work on, these technologies were thrown at us over the course of a single week. 
Trying to understand and read the documentation was the most challenging part 
however this was a great project that allowed me to research the problems I was encountering and strengthened my ability to understand and process documentation, which as always been a weak point for me as a visual learner.


## Conclusion
Overall a great project and I thoroughly enjoyed completeing it as I think NOSQL databases are an important concept to understand and utilize. Although this project took me longer than most other projects, I think it attests to the amount of knowledge I gained from completeing it.
